# Car
For this project, we'll be using two Latrax RC cars. We'll be keeping only the mechanical parts, the DC motor and servomotor.  
To control the car, we'll use an arduino Uno. To control the motor, we'll use a PWM-controlled IRLZ34N MOSFET.  
Bluetooth connection with the computer is via the HC05 module.  
To protect the Arduino, we'll use a pull-up resistor and a flyback diode.

## Problems encountered:
Our main problem is noise on the servomotor.

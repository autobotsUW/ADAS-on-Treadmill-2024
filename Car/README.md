# Car
For this project, we'll be using two Latrax RC cars. We'll be keeping only the mechanical parts, the DC motor and servomotor.  
To control the car, we'll use an arduino Uno. To control the motor, we'll use a PWM-controlled IRLZ34N MOSFET.  
Bluetooth connection with the computer is via the HC05 module.  
To protect the Arduino, we'll use a pull-up resistor and a flyback diode.

## Problems encountered:
Our main problem is noise on the servomotor.  
We tested the system with an Arduino Uno board and a Raspberry Pi Pico W. We noticed that the PWM generated by the Raspberry Pico was less stable than that generated by the Arduino, and therefore accentuated the noise phenomenon on the servo motor.  
To reduce the amplitude of the noise, we decided to supply the servo motor with 5V.  
To generate the PWM that controls the motor, we found that it was more efficient to generate it manually, using the writeMicroseconds function rather than the Library Arduino Servo.
